                            <p>My name is Adam Wenger. I am 21 years old and am currently taking classes at UNCC
                                for a web
                                developement bootcamp. I went to a 4 year college but wasn't putting in my best
                                effort,
                                partially for not knowing what I wanted to study or do for the rest of my life.
                                This time around
                                it will be different, I have enjoyed coding very much so far! I have a few
                                hobbies outside of
                                school. One is playing video games, I've been playing video games my entire life
                                and has always
                                been a great way to relax after a long day. My favorite games are shooters like
                                Call of Duty.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        On the more active side I LOVE bowling! I used to work at a bowling alley so that really started
                        my passion for it. I would bowl before and after work and on days off. I was there every single
                        day, I wish I could bowl half as much as I used to. Unfortunately it's a bit expensive, and I
                        dont have the time anymore. And last and my most important part of my life is my son Braden, He
                        is 11 months and is so cute! I love playing with him and making him laugh, he is the best.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once I complete this program I hope to get a good job and be able to provide a good life for my
                        family.
                    </p>
